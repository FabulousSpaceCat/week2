# week2

## Kitty ipsum gonna gitcha

This is just the page from week 1 upgraded with things I learned from week 2.  There's more semantics, a butt-ton of CSS for such a little page, and I might have even followed the instructions before I got carried away with myself.

- [x] Used more semantics for usability (I'm guessing this is for accessibility tools and robots)
- [x] Researched new CSS for layout ideas/methods
- [x] *OMG flexbox*
- [x] Virtual hug for [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com)
- [x] ~~Actually read the instructions and made revisions to follow along better~~
- [] Look into if I should be using margins or padding
- [] Research responsive design
