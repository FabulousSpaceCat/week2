# week2

## Kitty ipsum gonna gitcha

This is just the page from week 1 upgraded with things I learned from week 2.  There's more semantics and a butt-ton of CSS for such a little page. *If you're looking for homework, check the homework folder.*

- [x] Used more semantics for usability (I'm guessing this is for accessibility tools and robots)
- [x] Researched new CSS for layout ideas/methods
- [x] *OMG flexbox*
- [x] Virtual hug for [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com)
- [x] ~~Actually read the instructions and made revisions to follow along better~~
- [x] Look into if I should be using margins or padding
- [x] Research responsive design
- [x] Work on the same layout with the RWD tutorial
- [x] *OMG RWD thingy but in less of a good way*
- [] ~~*strangle image*~~
- [x] Okay actually do grid this time
- [x] *OMG grid*
- [x] ~~Can I make~~ I can make grid responsive
